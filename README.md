*Duration: 20 - 30 minutes*
**Introduction**

This mini test involves three quick tasks that involve real coding problems. We are looking for three things
as part of this test:

**Coding & Syntax**
Can you write good solutions that are clean, simple, organized and readable that demonstrate a good
knowledge of the language?

**Data Structure & Algorithms**
Do you understand runtime and space trade-offs and are able to implement optimal solutions?

**Problem solving**
Are you able to understand new problems, analyse existing code and come up with solutions quickly?

**Task 1**
Find the first recurring character of the provided lists and analyze the runtime vs space trade-off of your
solution. See “task1.js”.

**Task 2**
a) Provide line by line analysis of the performance of the provided code in terms of Big O notation, as
well as the overall performance of the function.

b) Write a new solution that has better performance, explaining why it has higher performance and if
there are any other improvements possible.

**Task 3**
Analyse the provided code, explain what it is doing, what problems you can find and any suggestions for
improvement.
